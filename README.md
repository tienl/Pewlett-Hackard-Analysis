# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The problem we are trying to solve here is, first, convert a mock company's human resource data from csv files into modern queryable data base and tables.  Additionally, we were tasked with technical analysis on retiring employee in various dimensions.  These analysis help the company manager to form business decision and strategy.  Specifically, a wave of employees are retiring forming a "silver tsunami", and the analysis provided clarity on who are the employees that will be retiring and their associated details.  

<!-- In your second paragraph, summarize the steps that you took to solve the problem, as well as the challenges that you encountered along the way. This is an excellent spot to provide examples and descriptions of the code that you used.

In your final paragraph, share the results of your analysis and discuss the data that youâ€™ve generated. Have you identified any limitations to the analysis? What next steps would you recommend? -->

For the first deliverable, I created a ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) first to help us understand how to create tables within the database, as well as it serves as a reference to aid us to form future analysis with various dimensions as needed.  Once the ERD and various tables were created, we were able to leverage 2 tables via query with inner join to form the data that we need.  We restricted the query for those that are retiring (those born 1952-1955) and grouped by their job title.  The data is then dumpted to deliv1 table.  Since the result has duplicates as employees held multiple positions over their tenure, we use a partition method to collect only a single instance of the result ordered by their latest postiion.  This second result is put into a second table called deliv1_2.  Lastly, the second deliverable identify those employee that have a specific birth dates within the year of 1965 for mentorship.  By using 2 inner joins of 3 tables, we are able to collect employee number (a common key to join on), first and last name, title and from and to date from their title.  

The result of the analysis shows that there are 133776 employee (deliverable1.1.csv), and with duplicates removed 90398 employees are in the retirement age group (deliverable1.2.csv).  We also found 3125 employees qualify for mentorship program as mentors (deliverable2.csv) by finding those born in 1965.  The limitation of the existing table and analysis does not distinguish clearly of the highest salary and their positions easily as there are duplicates within the deliverable2.csv table.  I recommend we run further dimensions to tease out the most current salary and position within the mentorship candidates.  We may also want to expeand the years of qualification for mentorship in case we need more participants to soften the "silver tsunami" impact.  Further interesting data can be obtained to help understand the payroll impact, so hiring can have a budget target as payroll frees up when employees retire.  All data and recommendation should be evaluated further by business owner as the recommendation and data here do not cover additional dimensions of business variables and procedures.
